This is the paper we will go over: [Modelling microtube driven invasion of glioma](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-023-02025-0)

# Full model
The model tracks 5 variables:
- $P(t,x,v)$ = TMT tips
- $M(t,x,v)$ = Mature TMT formed as the tip extends (the 'snail trial')
- $N(t,x,v)$ = Migrating nuclei.
- $B(t,x)$ = Bulk tumour mass
- $R(t,x)$ = Pre-bulk state, during which nuclei have stopped migrating and mature into bulk.

Each of $P(t,x,v), M(t,x,v)$ and $N(t,x,v)$ depend on time ($t\geq0$), position $x \in \omega$ where $\omega = \Re^n $ and orientation $v \in V = S^{n-1}$ with $S^{n-1}$ being the unit sphere. $B(t,x)$ and $R(t,x)$ vary only on time and position. 

The model equations are given by
