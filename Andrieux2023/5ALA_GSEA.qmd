Based on this paper [Spatially resolved transcriptomic profiles reveal unique defining molecular features of infiltrative 5ALA-metabolizing cells associated with glioblastoma recurrence](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01207-1) we get a list of genes for the 5ALA+ signature


# Load in 5ALA+ gene signature

```{R}

library(dplyr)

# load in the 5ALA+ gene signature
gene_5ALA <- read.csv("ALA pos gene list_final.csv")

head(gene_5ALA)
```
